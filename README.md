This repository contains R scripts to generate most of the figures and other results presented in Kobel et al. 2025 ([preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.05.626740))

The script `RCT_definition.Rmd` documents the DMM-based clustering of 16S rRNA gene amplicon data that was the starting point for the two rumen community types (RCTs) compared in the manuscript. The rest of the scripts are named according to the figure they correspond to.

Input data for the scripts is available in NIRD at XXXXX.

Packages were managed with `renv`; see [their documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for how to use this.
